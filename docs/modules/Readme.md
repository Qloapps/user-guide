# Manage Modules

The **Manage Modules** section in QloApps provides a simple and efficient way to oversee all installed, disabled and to update-ready modules. It allows the admin to:
 
- Install, uninstall, enable, or disable modules.
- Configure module settings to match your needs.
- Update modules for improved performance and security  alerts to notify if there's any issue.
- Quickly search and filter modules by enabled or disabled modules and by authors.

# Modules catalog

The **Modules Catalog** section in QloApps is a comprehensive marketplace that displays all available modules, add-ons, and themes that can be installed to extend the functionality and enhance the appearance of the hotel management system.

# Positions

The **Position Section** in QloApps allows admins to manage and customize the placement of modules across different parts of their hotel booking platform. 

This feature provides complete control over the layout and user interface.

Admin can also filter hooks using a dropdown menu, search for a specific hook by typing its name, and also view non-positionable hooks for better clarity and control.

# Payments

The **Payments section** in QloApps is a place where the admin decides what payment modules are available for different variations like **currency and Group.**

A check mark indicates you want the payment module available. If it is not checked then this means that the payment module is disabled.
