# Channel Manager

The **Channel Manager** tab integrates with QloApps to help hoteliers efficiently manage property details, and bookings across multiple Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) and online distribution channels.

It ensures real-time synchronization, eliminating manual effort and reducing errors.

## **What is a Channel Manager?**
A **channel manager** is centralized software that:
- Synchronizes property availability, rates, and restrictions across multiple OTAs and distribution channels.
- Automates the synchronization of bookings between connected OTAs and the QloApps PMS.

With QloApps Channel Manager, properties can easily connect with OTAs.


## **Connection Status**
Displays the current connection status with the channel manager.
  - **Status:** Indicates whether the property is connected or not.
  - **Last Updated:** Shows the last synchronization timestamp.
  Example: *"Connection status: Not Connected."*

- The connection status reflects whether bookings are successfully fetched from the **QloApps Channel Manager**.
