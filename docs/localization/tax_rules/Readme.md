# Tax Rules

From the **Tax Rules** Section of QloApps, the admin can create and manage tax rules to define how taxes are applied based on various criteria such as country, state, or region.

Tax rules can combine multiple tax rates, ensuring accurate tax calculations for guests from different locations.
