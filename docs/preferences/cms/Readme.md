CMS content is managed using two properties: Categories and Pages

- **Categories:** These allow you to centralize similar pages under a single section for better organization and navigation. By default, all pages are grouped under the "Home" category, but you can create new categories as needed to structure your content effectively.

- **Pages**: You can create new pages within the appropriate category or keep them under the default "Home" category, depending on your requirements.
