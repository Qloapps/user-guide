# Catalog Price Rules

Catalog Price Rules allow you to assign price reductions based on categories, applying discounts to a range of products rather than a single product. With Catalog Price Rules in QloApps, you can offer discounts on your hotel rooms based on criteria such as currency, country, or customer groups.
