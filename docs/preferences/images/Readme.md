# Images

The **Images Section** in QloApps is designed to optimize your website's performance by automatically processing uploaded images. When you upload an image, QloApps intelligently breaks it down into multiple resolutions based on the predefined settings. This ensures that the right image size is displayed across different devices, providing a faster and more seamless experience for your visitors

The admin can also toggle the visibility of images for Room Types, Products, Categories, and Hotels, enabling or disabling them as needed for better organization and display management.
