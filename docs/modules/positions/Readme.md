# Positions

The **Position Section** in QloApps allows admins to manage and customize the placement of modules across different parts of their hotel booking platform.

This feature provides complete control over the layout and user interface.

Admin can also filter hooks using a dropdown menu, search for a specific hook by typing its name, and also view non-positionable hooks for better clarity and control.
