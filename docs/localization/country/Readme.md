# Country

The **Countries Section** allows you to manage country-specific settings for your hotel. You can add, edit, or delete countries based on your business requirements.

Here, the admin can view the **ISO code, call prefix, zone and toggle the enable/disable** status of the country.

By default, only your own country is available in the list of countries.
