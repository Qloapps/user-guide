# Cart Rules

The Cart Rules section in QloApps allows hotel administrators to create and manage promotional discounts and offers for their guests.

These discounts can be tailored based on date ranges, minimum booking amounts, countries, customer groups, or room types.

# Catalog price rule

Catalog Price Rules allow you to assign price reductions based on categories, applying discounts to a range of products rather than a single product. With Catalog Price Rules in QloApps, you can offer discounts on your hotel rooms based on criteria such as currency, country, or customer groups.
